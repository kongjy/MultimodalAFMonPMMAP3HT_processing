# Multimodal AFM on PMMA & P3HT 
Repository containing data, analysis workflow, and I/O and analysis scripts for processing multimodal atomic force 
microscopy data in the paper titled ["Identifying Nanoscale Structureâ€“Function Relationships Using Multimodal Atomic 
Force Microscopy, Dimensionality Reduction, and Regression Techniques."](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01003)
If you find the notebook and workflow here useful, we'd appreciate if you cited our paper. 

### About the Notebook
The notebook contains extensive annotation via comments and additional information regarding the analysis can also be 
found in the SI of the paper. Broadly, the analysis steps are as follow:

1. Register PiFM and cAFM image data.
2. Apply PCA to the hyperspectral data.
3. Perform PCR using the registered image data and first 10 PCs. 
4. Calculate error metrics (F-statistic, RSS, R<sup>2</sup>)
5. Error analysis showing utility of combining PiFM and cAFM image data. 
6. Hyperspectral unmixing results using standard inputs with a variety of techniques (NMF, ATGP, NFINDR, PPI, and VCA).
7. How each SI figure was generated. 

### Other Information
The notebook was written in Python 3.5. Aside from the typical Python computing packages (like scipy, numpy, and
sklearn), [dipy](https://dipy.org/) is required. 

If you are interested in registering multimodal image data, check out this repository where I provide a step-by-step
tutorial (beginning with installing Python with Conda) on how to do so with dipy. It also contains commentary on what's 
happening under the hood. If you use dipy for image registration, please cite the package according to the guidelines as
indicated by the developers of the package [here](https://dipy.org/documentation/1.1.1./cite/#a-note-on-citing-our-work).
